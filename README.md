# Laravel & Vue.js Project Setup

This project is built with Laravel 11 and Vue.js 3. It uses Laravel Sail for a local development environment and Vite for bundling assets. This README will guide you through setting up the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **PHP** `8.2.10` or higher
- **Composer** `^2.5`
- **Node.js** `18.x` (use `.nvmrc` to manage versions)
- **MySQL** `8.x` or compatible database
- **Docker** (for using Laravel Sail, optional but recommended)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
2. Set Up Environment Variables
Copy the .env.example file to .env:

bash
Copy code
cp .env.example .env
Update database credentials and other sensitive information in the .env file.

3. Install Backend Dependencies
Install PHP dependencies using Composer:

bash
Copy code
composer install
4. Install Frontend Dependencies
Use npm ci to install the exact dependencies specified in package-lock.json:

bash
Copy code
npm ci
5. Set Up Laravel Sail (Optional but recommended)
If you're using Docker for your local development environment, you can set up Laravel Sail:

bash
Copy code
./vendor/bin/sail up -d
This will start the Laravel Sail containers for MySQL, Redis, etc. If you're not using Sail, ensure your local environment is configured correctly to match the .env file settings.

6. Run Database Migrations
Migrate the database to set up the schema:

bash
Copy code
php artisan migrate --seed
7. Compile Frontend Assets
Compile the frontend assets using Vite:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
8. Run the Application
Start the Laravel development server:

bash
Copy code
php artisan serve
You can now access the application at http://localhost:8000.

Verify Setup
Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
Ensure that all routes, pages, and assets load correctly.
Troubleshooting
Route Not Found
If you're getting route errors, run:

bash
Copy code
php artisan route:clear && php artisan route:cache
Missing Inertia or Breeze Files
Ensure the following files exist and are set up as per the Breeze default configuration:

resources/js/app.js
resources/views/app.blade.php
Asset Compilation Errors
Make sure Node.js and npm versions match the .nvmrc version. You can also try clearing npm cache and reinstalling dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm cache clean --force
npm ci
Contribution Guidelines
Lock Dependencies
Always commit composer.lock and package-lock.json after updating dependencies to ensure consistency across environments.

Branching Strategy
Create feature branches prefixed with feature/ or bugfix/.
Merge changes into main only after code review.
Linting
Run the following command to lint JavaScript and Vue files:

bash
Copy code
npm run lint
Testing
Before pushing any changes, run unit tests to ensure everything is working:

bash
Copy code
php artisan test
Environment Variables
Refer to .env.example for a list of environment variables and their descriptions. Important fields to configure:

DB_CONNECTION: Database type (e.g., mysql).
DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD: Database credentials.
MAIL_*: Mail configuration for sending emails.
VITE_APP_NAME: The name of the app used in Vite.
Versioning
PHP: ^8.2.10
Laravel: ^11.31.0
Node.js: 18.x
MySQL: 8.x
Ensure compatibility using .nvmrc for Node.js and commit lock files (composer.lock, package-lock.json) for consistent dependencies across your team.

Docker (Optional)
If you're using Laravel Sail, make sure you have Docker installed and running. Sail will set up all necessary containers (e.g., MySQL, Redis) for local development.

To start Sail:

bash
Copy code
./vendor/bin/sail up -d
Summary of Best Practices
Use .env.example for sharing configurations securely.
Commit lock files (composer.lock, package-lock.json) to ensure consistent dependency versions.
Document setup steps thoroughly in README.md.
Use version managers like .nvmrc and Sail for consistency across environments.
Regularly update and test your dependencies.
